# Java Web Services

These are my backend Java services made in a class at The University of California, Irvine.

The services are essentially form a connection to a MySQL database that stores "products" for our make-believe store application.

The services make use of the open source "Jersey" framework. Check it out [here](https://jersey.github.io/)

## Running the code

The repo follows a standard Java Web Services layout, and so the easiest way to run would be to clone the repo, and import it as a Web Project in an IDE, which will handle the compilation and server provision for you.
